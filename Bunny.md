Thank you for watching over me while my pops travels! I think we're going to have a great time & here are some helpful things to know about me.

# TLDR
- Looove being pet _inside_ my ears
- Has a minor case of wobbly cat where I'm a bit uncoordinated. Otherwise I'm a lot like other cats!
- Makes a mess around the litter box

# Health & Satefy Stuff ü©∫
- The vets say I have a _very_ minor case of Cerebellar Hypoplasia [CH] or "wobbly cat" meaning I'm a little uncoordinated. 
   - The good news is that I don't hop on counters (aka counter surfing), but this also means I won't jump directly on your lap if you're sitting in an office chair. Instead, I feel more comfortable pulling myself up by digging my claws into your pants and walking over your keyboard. Jeans can be recommended. 
   - With my condition, I don't get my nails trimmed so I can build strength. There's this spray I'm not a fan of so I'll avoid those areas.
- My left eye gets a litty runny and that's okay per my last vet visit. 
- Oh! Also, I like to play with and around doors. I can open doors and might try to go outside. I've become less curious by the "great outdoors" but my inner longing for roam the savvanah may arise again. 

# Cute Stuff üòª
- I casually practice dressage or ballet when I'm playful. I love those cat toy balls with a metal jingle inside, oh my! And there's this wand with different attachments. Love love love!
- I mainly trill vs meow as meowing is a cat's yelling. Good thing I was told this early in my life so I can have longlasting healthy vocal cords!
- I'm very much a lap cat and like sleeping on a hoo-man's stomach/chest and neck area. Sorry if I step on your trachea üò¨
- I like Cat TV and looking outside. 
- I will playfully paw at your feet when I'm having zoomies.

# General Handling & Notes ü´∂
- Like a lot of feline friends, I'm quite independent & want pets only some of the time & on my terms. I love the inside of my ears scritched, the middle of face & nose area where I'll probably blep, and my chin/cheeks scratched. Once I've had too much, I'll either lick you as a thanks or go about my business. 
- Not a fan of being picked up and will protest everytime. We're trying to get used to it.
- Although I sleep in my carrier from time to time, I'm quite astute if you're trying to get me to go into the carrier. I don't like the closed off spaces even if it's for my own safety. I know I get tricked with food/churu in a bowl toward the back where I'll take a bite and back out. Let the games begin!
- For litter, I make an absolute mess with litter around the box... sorry ü•∫
- For other cats, I've been around a few different cats & kittens with different degrees of success. 

## Food & Water
- I'll be on kitten food until ~September 2023. But I think [I'm an adult!](https://youtu.be/gAYL5H46QnQ?t=54)
- I'm used to eating 3 meals a day where breakfast (9AM) & lunch (3PM) are dry food and dinner (9PM) is half a can of wet food with some dry food. I love churu and used to licking it off hands as I just want to bite the tube out of excitement. Chomp munch nom nom nosh. Did I mention I have a great sense of time where I'll persuade you to feed me a bit earlier?
