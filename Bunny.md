Thank you for watching over me while my pops travels! I think we're going to have a great time & here are some helpful things to know about me.

## Health & Satefy Stuff ðŸ©º
The vets say I have a _very_ minor case of Cerebellar Hypoplasia [CH] or "wobbly cat" meaning I'm a little uncoordinated. The good news is that I don't hop on counters (aka counter surfing), but this also means I won't jump directly on your lap if you're sitting in an office chair. Instead, I feel more comfortable pulling myself up by digging my claws into your pants and walking over your keyboard. Jeans can be recommended. With my condition, I don't get my nails trimmed so I can build strength. There's this spray I'm not a fan of so I'll avoid those areas.

My left eye gets a litty runny and that's okay per my last vet visit. 

Oh! Also, I like to play with and around doors. I can open doors

## Cute Stuff ðŸ˜»
I casually practice dressage or ballet when I'm playful. I love those cat toy balls with a metal jingle inside, oh my! And there's this wand with different attachments.

I mainly trill vs meow as meowing is a cat's yelling. Good thing I was told this early in my life so I can have longlasting healthy vocal cords!

I'm very much a lap cat and like sleeping on hoo-man's stomach/chest and neck area. Sorry if I step on your trachea ðŸ˜¬

I like Cat TV and looking outside. 

## General Handling ðŸ«¶
Like a lot of feline friends, I'm quite independent & want pets only some of the time & on my terms. I love the inside of my ears scritched, the middle of face & nose area where I'll probably blep, and my chin/cheeks scratched. Once I've had too much, I'll either lick you as a thanks or go about my business. 

Not a fan of being picked up and will protest everytime. We're trying to get used to it.

Although I sleep in my carrier from time to time, I'm quite astute if you're trying to get me to go into the carrier. I don't like the closed off spaces even if it's for my own safety. I know I get tricked with food/churu in a bowl toward the back where I'll take a bite and back out. Let the games begin!

For litter, I make a mess... sorry ðŸ¥º

### Food & Water
I'll be on kitten food until September 2023 or so. But I think [I'm an adult!](https://youtu.be/gAYL5H46QnQ?t=54)

I'm used to eating 3 meals a day where breakfast & lunch are dry food and dinner is half a can of wet food. I love churu and used to licking it off hands as I just want to bite the tube out of excitement.

## Supplies
- Cat food (wet and dry)
