# The Cat Doc

Thank you for watching over me while my pops travels! I think we're going to have a great time & here are some helpful things to know about me.

# TLDR
- Most Adorable Cat Award Recipient 🏆
- **Looove** being pet _inside_ my ears
- Has a minor case of wobbly cat syndrome where I'm a bit uncoordinated. Otherwise I'm a lot like other cats!
- Makes a mess around the litter box

# Health & Safety Stuff 🩺
- The vets say I have a _very_ minor case of Cerebellar Hypoplasia [CH] or "wobbly cat" meaning I'm a little uncoordinated. 
   - The good news is that I don't hop on counters (aka counter surfing), but this also means I won't jump directly on your lap if you're sitting in an office chair. Instead, I feel more comfortable pulling myself up by digging my claws into your pants and walking over your keyboard. Jeans can be recommended. 
   - With my condition, it's recommended that my nails remain untrimmed so I can build strength climbing on all the things. There's this spray I'm not a fan of so I'll avoid those areas.
- My left eye gets a little runny and that's okay per my last vet visit. 
- Oh! Also, I like to play with and around doors. I can open the doors inside the house. 
   - I _might_ try to go outside. I've become less curious by the "great outdoors" but my inner longing to roam the savannah may arise once again.

# Cute Stuff 😻
- I think I'm a Calico Ragdoll? Not sure, I just know I'm cute.
- Casually practices dressage or ballet when I'm playful, which is often. I love those cat toy balls with a metal jingle inside, oh my! And there's this wand with different attachments. Love love love!
- Will playfully paw at your feet when I'm having zoomies.
- Mainly trills vs meows as meowing is a cat's yelling. Good thing I was told this early in my life so I can have long lasting healthy vocal cords!
- Very much a lap cat and like sleeping on a hoo-man's stomach/chest and neck area. Sorry if I step on your trachea 😬
- Likes Cat TV and looking outside. 

# General Handling & Notes 🫶
- Like a lot of feline friends, I'm quite independent & want pets only some of the time & on my terms. I love the inside of my ears scritched, the middle of my face & nose area where I'll probably blep, and my chin/cheeks scratched. Once I've had too much, I'll either lick you as a thanks or go about my business. 
- Not a fan of being picked up and will protest everytime. We're trying to get used to it.
- Although I sleep in my carrier from time to time, I'm quite astute if you're trying to get me to go into the carrier. I don't like closed off spaces even if it's for my own safety. I know I get tricked with food/churu in a bowl toward the back where I'll take a bite and back out. Let the games begin!
- For litter, I make an absolute mess with litter around the box... sorry 🥺
- For other cats, I've been around a few different cats & kittens with different degrees of success. It's all about the vibes and you can't describe vibes in words iykyk yk? 
- I've gone through about 4 collars that I refuse to keep on. I'm persistent and know what I like.

## Food & Water 🦃🐓
- I'll be on kitten food until ~September 2023. But I think [I'm an adult!](https://youtu.be/gAYL5H46QnQ?t=54)
- I'm used to eating 3 meals a day where breakfast (9AM) & lunch (3PM) are dry food and dinner (9PM) is half a can of wet food with some dry food. I love Churu and am used to licking it off hands as I just want to bite the tube out of excitement. Chomp munch nom nom nosh. Did I mention I have a great sense of time where I'll persuade you to feed me a bit earlier?
- I prefer water from surfaces so you'll find me hopping in the shower as soon as you're done. Or sometimes I'll just hop in there hoping there's that sweet sweet water droplet.
