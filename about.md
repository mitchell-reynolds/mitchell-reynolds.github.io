I'm Mitchell Reynolds and here's a digital representation of me:

Professionally, Iâ€™m a Data Science Manager at Hint Water where I focus on growth marketing & operations with the help of Diet ML.

Personally, I enjoy contradictions. Everything from broadly bad movies (The Room etc.) to
[great niche films](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vAO7SOU4HMdmlH4HayZ801kqPu_32CIsfk5mF0Co0ZM/edit?usp=sharing);
playing guitar left-handed while being right-handed everywhere else; and meditating every day then later lifting weights listening to heavy metal.

Writing gives me clarity & will focus on:

- [Artificial General Intelligence & Safety](https://www.alignmentforum.org/)
- [Eudaimonia & Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia)
- [Zen & Mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen)

Intellectually, I largely identify as an
[Effective Altruist](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism),
[Longtermist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism),
[Deontologist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/),
[Rationalist](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality), and
[Aspiring Polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath).

I practice [taking control](https://www.humanetech.com/take-control)
of and reducing my reliance on technology & media.
Therefore, you should anticipate longer than normal response times from the above.

Lastly, I optimize with the end in mind & make a large update to my
[Bucket List](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13PBCeHsg2fWXOJ0NDQTl7dovCwSd5jfSxYgwVC6YC_4/edit?usp=sharing)
every spring equinox with smaller updates about once per quarter.
