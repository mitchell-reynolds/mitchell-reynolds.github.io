I'm Mitchell Reynolds and here's a digital representation of me:

## Professionally:
Iâ€™m a Data Science Manager where I have extensive experience 
interfacing between business stakeholders & technical teams.

## Personally:
I enjoy contradictions. Everything from broadly bad movies (The Room etc.) to
[great niche films](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vAO7SOU4HMdmlH4HayZ801kqPu_32CIsfk5mF0Co0ZM/edit?usp=sharing);
playing guitar left-handed while being right-handed everywhere else; 
and meditating every day then later lifting weights listening to metalcore.
My other hobbies range from playing tabletop games, discussing philosophy (focus on ethics & consciousness),
and supporting the arts through comedy & experiential art.

## Purpose (blog specific):
Writing gives me clarity & will focus on:

- [Artificial General Intelligence & Safety](https://www.alignmentforum.org/)
- [Eudaimonia & Ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia)
- [Zen & Mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen)

## Purpose (lifelong):
I've defined my own life purpose to be something like:
- Be a polymath (scientist, philosopher, artist, mover)
   - Sciences: Economics; Engineering (AI/ML focus)
   - Philosophy: AI Safety; Ethics
   - Arts: Guitarist; Writer; Artist
   - Mover: Chess Boxing; Climbing; Top 5% physically by benching bodyweight, squatting 1.5x, and deadlifting 2x bodyweight
- Reduce suffering, increase happiness/eudaimonia & try to not cause harm (see intellectual identification below)
- Have fun because life is absurd

Around each spring equinox, I make a major update to 
[my bucket list](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13PBCeHsg2fWXOJ0NDQTl7dovCwSd5jfSxYgwVC6YC_4/edit?usp=sharing)
with quarterly updates. I'm prone to dipping into existential nihilism where the vain reflection 
on what I've overcome & accomplished has been instrumental in maintaining my mental health. 
I plan on using something more like [YearCompass](https://yearcompass.com/) starting in 2023.

## Intellectually:
I largely identify as an
[Effective Altruist](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism),
[Longtermist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism),
[Ethical Deontologist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/),
[Rationalist](https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality), 
[Absurdist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism), and
[Aspiring Polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath).
