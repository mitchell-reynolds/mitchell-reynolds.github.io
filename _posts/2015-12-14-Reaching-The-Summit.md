What important truth do very few people agree with you?
Peter Thiel opens with this challenge in Zero to One. Some responses he alludes to are: "God is Dead" and "The American school system is broken." The first was controversial at its concept, yet Atheism has since become widespread. The second is true and purely argumentative. However, neither of those statements correctly answers his contrarian question. The key to answering this quandary correctly is purposefully difficult, and only one way exists to solve it properly: you have to think for yourself.

Zero to One gives a theoretical approach on how to Think Different and build the future in the form of authentic entrepreneurship. His central conclusion and counterclaim to common culture: create a monopoly and avoid competition. How can this be? Aren't we freedom-loving Americans suppose to rally in favor of a free market? However, every successful business began by monopolizing a small market then growing it into relevant spaces. One example, a small online retailer of vintage books sold out of Jeff Bezos' garage eventually became a company called Amazon. I think you've heard of it.

I absolutely agree with Thiel's astute assertion. It's not easy, and it's not impossible - much like dividing by zero using limits. Furthermore, I wish to expand his claim into a pragmatic discussion directed to the entrepreneur and to those fascinated by the topic. Most importantly, I believe that he missed a fundamental point of exploration.

The Current Contrarian
Do you have an idea that will revolutionize the world? Focus your energy into making it a reality and a common truth. Notice my call to action ignores what others are actively doing in the market. If it's truly a great idea, most likely many others are already in pursuit of your objective. Therefore, you can either start from scratch (and enter competition?) or join a team en route to actualization.

In other words, do you currently have the skill set to begin building? If you're truly passionate about your hidden truth, then you should pursue that objective with every fiber of your being.

The Truth Visionary
What if you don't have current skill set for your vision? And, others are pursuing your dream? Even better! Assuming you are energetic about your dream and not yet an expert, then you should already be assembling skills for actualizing your hidden truth.

The purpose of authentic entrepreneurship is to originate a truly novel idea that others have yet to foresee. Specifically, envisioning the world not how it is today but rather how it is in the future and solving hypothetical problems before they arrive. Simply put, think about today's problems and how the solution to those issues will give rise to new problems in the future. I'll use some examples to prove this as having the greatest probability of success.

Tesla and Energy
Tesla created the electric cars to reduce the world's dependence on gasoline that cause a high level of pollution. Yet, electric vehicles rely on the coal-dependent grid system, which also create marginal pollution. The next step in solving this problem will be to provide clean energy. Why do you think Elon Musk is also Chairman of SolarCity? He's finalizing his vision for a better Earth.

Comfortable Autonomous Vehicles
Multiple reports have spun-out of large banks betting on self-driven cars, which we will see mass adoption in roughly fifteen years. Assuming they reach full autonomy, then I believe those consumers will have an increased demand in relaxation and entertainment within these new vehicles. Think car specific blankets and pillows; redesigned seats and seating; and better connectivity for mobile phone and tablet usage.

Internet... Of Things
Mobile phones, tablets, laptops and computers are the center of daily life. Yet, the problem exists that with all this connectivity that individuals can often be overwhelmed with information and countless notifications from their multiple devices. Already, many large corporations are putting a stake into the Internet of Things (IOT - where things can be treated as a variable) to solve this small issue and address larger ones. The goal will be connect a user's multiple devices and predict what the individual wants as it is happening. Right now the internet is reactive. The IOT will be proactively providing you with only relevant information.

The Head Fake
I'm biased. I believe all the above ventures will converge within one another and cannot wait for this future to materialize. The IOT will connect cars and dramatically increase the efficiency of travel and increase safety. Tesla already provides software updates that will eventually come with self-driven features. 

Have you found my hidden truth?

If you gathered that I'm passionate about futuristic thinking, autonomous vehicles and the IOT, then the only logical conclusion is that I'm learning the skills for this future. The Internet of Cars will require a specific skill set that I have yet to fully understand. A nexus of economics and data science will ensure success. It won't be easy, and it's not impossible. I know each step I take will inevitably allow me to reach the summit of my vision.
