Since being laid off at the start of 2023, my time and energy have been split into various buckets where one of the most inefficient has been handling bureaucracies where I've coped with the insanity of the existing system with humor and possible hubris with how it can be done better. Overall, I spend ~45 hours per week on Bureaucracy, Volunteering, Studying, and on my Job Search.

### Bureaucracy (5 hours per week)

My LinkedIn has the selected bullet points where I'll expand further right below:

> - Volunteering to give back to my community while preparing for graduate school after being laid off, **receiving unemployment benefits** while applying to 30+ roles prioritizing AI Safety organizations.
> - UCLA Extension: Student for Database Management Certificate fully sponsored by WIOA grant.
> - The Outpost: Treasurer managing finances, establishing bylaws, & leading lease negotiations. 

#### Expansion of the 3 above Points
- [10] Employment Development Department (EDD): Every other week I need to certify that I'm willing and able to work. I track my job search activity in Trello as each activity has various levels of engagement (networking event, application, `nth` interview, work tests). The certification for benefits and related paperwork is about 1 hour per month.
   - [60] California Training Benefits (CTB): After ~20 hours of research into the massive web of requirements, I contacted EDD via email and by phone to ensure they received my intent to pursue CTB. Then, I later interviewed with a different EDD representative to determine my eligibility. Then, UCLA has to fax my proof of enrollment to EDD within 2 business days.
       - WIOA Grant, UCLA Extension, & Career Center: EDD recommended that I reach out to my career center, fill out half a dozen forms, apply to UCLA, and send about a dozen emails between the various organizations listed here. I also file additional paperwork showing I've attended courses and updated forms showing my plan for attaining the certificate.
       - Combining everything in the pursuit of CTB excluding the normal EDD process was about 60 hours
- [5] CalFresh: My physical mail got delayed and missed the SAR 7 updated timeline. Filed for an appeal and got it corrected with an estimate of 5 hours total.
- [10] Medi-Cal: Thankful to have insurance provided by California, and the process took about 10 hours in total before I saw my Primary Care Provider.
- [10] California Franchise Tax Board (FTB): One of my previous employer's left a field blank on my W2. Followed up with the company 7 times over 3 months, met with an accountant where they suggested I file anyway, and got a noticed from the FTB showing I owed more in State Taxes, called to resolve the matter and created an account through FTB to submit all my W2s and my last pay stub. I'd estimate about 10 hours were spent on this.
- [20] The Outpost: My roommates & I are fortunate to have rent control in Berkeley, but we needed to update the lease in order to add in new roommates like myself. Given my comparative advantage of being Treasurer at McAllister House, I spent ~20 hours on: research for Berkeley rental laws; contacting the housing board and several non-profit law firms that specialize in tenant rights; main point of contact for the 50+ email thread (I'd often follow up after a week of no response from the company); and organizing housemates to have a shared vision for our requests.

Ironically, I spent an estimated ~5 hours each week on the above bureaucracy where I needed to be on top of my email and have my phone nearby, which definitely made deep work and focus difficult. Additionally, the stress of not knowing what to do and that it's one's own responsibility to own the process and to be consistent. Yet, the cost-benefit analysis on this is quite clear to go through all the red tape to earn the benefits above. However, it is a deadweight loss on the economy where the average US Citizen spends [35 hours per year and rising](https://bigthink.com/the-present/sludge-americans-paperwork-cass-sunstein/#:~:text=The%20ICB%20quantifies%20the%20annual,has%20been%20growing%20over%20time.) on federal paperwork.

#### Suprisingly Simple Solution
It seems rather straightforward (prima facie) to connect US Citizen information where each endpoint requires authorization (eg EDD & WIOA) and some (EDD & CalFresh) are already connected. Also, the usage of fax machines and paper mail are obsolete for today's time. Email or online portals should be the main form of contact yet these are not available for certain processes.

### Volunteer Efforts & Studying (30 hours per week)
My LinkedIn also has the following bullet points:

> - BlueDot Impact: Lead Facilitator for AI Technical Safety & for AI Governance courses.
> - Effective Altruism Community Building: Co-founder for SF Bay Area local group non-profit (in process).
> - UCLA Extension: Student for Database Management Certificate fully sponsored by WIOA grant. 
> - MS in Computer Science: Applying to GA Tech, UCLA, UC Berkeley, & others by EOY.

When I meet others and they inevitably ask "So what do you do?" I only mention these points which take up about 30 hours on average and are the best for my "brand" for the time being. 

### Job Search (10 hours per week)
I spend about 10 hours on the job search process, which has a range of activities of networking events, applications, the `nth` interview, and work tests.
