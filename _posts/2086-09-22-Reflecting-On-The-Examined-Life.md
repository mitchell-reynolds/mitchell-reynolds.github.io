As a reflective nonagenarian in the year 2086, I began with the end in mind 
and worked both backwards & forwards to ensure my life story would be written exactly as I envisioned.

## Poverty & Overcoming

My parents, grandparents, & great-grandparents all had children before 20 years young. 
I had the privilege of meeting my great-grandparents who'd fought in WWII & of
hearing the worldviews from those in the early 20th century. 
We're now nearing the 22nd century. 
Even though they all lacked an undergraduate education, they were supportive in their own ways
including the deep value of reasoning for its own sake & thinking for one's self.

As a young person, my focus was on survival, rather than traditional notions of success. 
I worked tirelessly to make ends meet, both in high school and university.
