It's 2086, and I'm now 95 years old. Through the years, I kept "the end in mind" and worked backwards & forwards. This is the story I wrote long ago & was made true in smalls ways with every passing day.

## Poverty & Overcoming

My parents, grandparents, & great-grandparents all had children by 20. I had the privilege of meeting my great-grandparents who'd fought in WWII & hearing the worldviews of those in the early 20th century. We're now nearing the 22nd century. Even though they all lacked an undergraduate education, they were supportive in their own ways including the deep value of reasoning for its own sake & thinking for one's self.
