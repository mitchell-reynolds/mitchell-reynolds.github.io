# Outline

I believe there are 5 major components for a person being competent in their role:
1. Intelligence & [Aptitude](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bud2ssJLQ33pSemKH/my-current-impressions-on-career-choice-for-longtermists)
2. Worth ethic / commitment
3. Role & Fit
4. Company Culture & Fit
5. Something else (TODO)
