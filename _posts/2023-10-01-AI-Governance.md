# Week 1

# Week 2

## Prompt:
> Do you think risks arising from misuse, accidents, or rogue, agentic AI systems, are more likely to cause harm? Does this answer change when limiting your time horizon to 5 years, 15 years and 30 years? Aim to write <= 400 words.

> You may wish to consider:
> Whether you feel these are useful categories of risk. What is the scale of the harm caused by each scenario? How you think each risk might concretely manifest as an actual scenario.
> If you are not compelled by any of the risks outlined in this weekâ€™s resources, or from your own experience, feel free to structure your essay around reasons why you believe catastrophic AI risks won't materialize.
