I have mild dyslexia where I'm attuned to fonts and to optimal reading. A person reading English averages [about 200 words per minute [WPM]](https://secure.execuread.com/facts/). This can be roughly doubled (500 WPM) by simply following along with a bookmark on a physical book. I've tested myself on these reading speeds. Speed Reading courses claim to 4-6x some of these base rates up to 2000 WPM.
There are also Chrome Extensions that can increase online reading speed (200 WPM) by fixing one's focus to a specific point and found the 2-3X increase to be comfortable and retainable.

For audio, a person [speaks at 140 WPM](https://tfcs.baruch.cuny.edu/speaking-rate/) on average. Therefore, podcasts can be doubled to reach average reading speeds without a bookmark.

For video, it's unclear how to best measure this beyond the film/documentary spoken 140 WPM. The information gain by an actor saying a line but conveying more with their body language could plausibly 3X the information gain, but I have low confidence in this claim.
