# Background, Context, & Goals
This is the first installment of my summary for the Artificial General Intelligence Safety Fundamentals Program [Program] offered by [BlueDot,](https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/)
which spun out of Effective Altruism Cambridge in collaboration with [Richard Ngo.](https://www.richardcngo.com/)
My involvement with the Program began in 2021 where I started as a participant facilitated by Michael Chen. 
In 2022 and 2023, I was offered to be a paid facilitator for 1 cohort each iteration. 

My goals for facilitating are to:
1. Improve participants understanding on this important topic
2. Establish connections with those also interested in contributing to the AI alignment problem
   - Connections (Direct work): Either these folks will be future colleagues or will have overlap in
   - Connections (Indirect work): As most participants are technical, I can see a future where SWE/researchers are working for any of the [MAMAA](https://fortune.com/2021/10/29/faang-mamaa-jim-cramer-tech-facebook-meta/) companies and could be part of the capabilities frontier.
3. Improve my clarity and communication around this challenging topic while also staying up to date on the latest research
4. [Bonus] Establish myself as a credible & knowledgeable source of AGI safety information
5. [Bonus] Directly contribute to the advancement of ["helpful, honest, and harmless"](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2112.00861) AI systems with a focus on strategy
