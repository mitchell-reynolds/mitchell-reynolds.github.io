At the start of 2022, I made a pact to myself to read 1 book a month and will update this periodically as I finish them.
I do like [Holden Karnofsky's cold take for _Honesty about Reading._](https://www.cold-takes.com/honesty-about-reading/) as there is just too much to read in what little time we have on this planet. In my own writing, I will do my best to write up "a TL;DR on what I'm arguing, what the main evidence is, why it matters, and what my responses to key objections are."
