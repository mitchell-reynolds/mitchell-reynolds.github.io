I recently listened to a podcast where the hosts were talking about their various jobs.
It made me reflect on the many I've had in my first 30 years.

I get the sense that most of my peers worked during HS/undergraduate to have extra spending or fun money.
I got my first several jobs to survive & to feed myself starting in high school.
It became even more pronounced during my undergraduate & reduced my eating to twice daily.
I had an underweight BMI until my upper 20s. Similarly, I developed hobbies around the same age.

# Hard Lessons Learned from being Low Skill Labor
- These lessons are meant to be for my younger self and not widely applicable. They are written mainly for my younger brothers.
- For low skill positions, they **will** exploit you since you're so easily replaceable. Never share personal details and don't expect friendships to form here. Be respectful but detached.
- Coming from a working class background, the belief that "working hard" will eventually pay off is bad advice until Post Undergraduate. I think "working smarter" is almost always better than "working harder" as the former can be sustained (caveats apply that I won't go into detail here).
- For _minimum_ wage jobs, the goal should be working toward the _minimum_ level of effort required. That seems fair.
- After my undergraduate working full-time, high skill employers really don't care those low skill positions. The competition was able to secure internships/research roles while you were trying to survive. It is in the employers best interest to choose the talent who has slightly relevant work experience & uncertain work ethic VS no relevant work experience & equally uncertain work ethic.
- Notice the irony between the last two points (ie work toward the minimum effort; employers think you're doing this). It's extremely unlikely any of your professional employers will reach out to your low skill employers to see if you were the exception. _Note, I explored the naive "word harder" approach with very little return._

# Soft Lessons Learned from being Low Skill Labor
- Be kind. Even if I was having a tough day, I made the effort to be kind & polite. Others will naturally reciprocate and it'll end up making your day slightly better.
- A mantra I still use is "If you had lived that person's exact life, you'd likely be just like them." I think this deepens empathy while also respecting one's agency as two people can have nearly identical experiences but have different outcomes. 
- Always tip. If you're out to eat, you should factor in tipping as part of your meal.
