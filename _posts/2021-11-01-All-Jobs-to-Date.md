I recently listened to a podcast where the hosts were talking about their various jobs.
It made me reflect on the many I've had in my first 30 years.

I get the sense that most of my peers worked during HS/undergraduate to have extra spending or fun money. My first 10 years of work was to provide myself transportation and to feed myself. The most difficult point was during my undergraduate years where I reduced my eating to twice daily. I had an underweight BMI until Post Undergraduate.

# Hard Lessons Learned from being Low Skill Labor
- These lessons are meant to be for my younger self and not widely applicable. They are written mainly for my younger brothers.
- For low skill positions, they will exploit you since you're so easily replaceable. Never share personal details and don't expect friendships to form here. Be respectful but detached.
- Coming from a working class background, the belief that "working hard" will eventually pay off is bad advice until Post Undergraduate. I think "working smarter" is almost always better than "working harder" as the former can be sustained (caveats apply that I won't go into detail here).
- For _minimum_ wage jobs, the goal should be working toward the _minimum_ level of effort required. That seems fair.
- After my undergraduate working full-time, high skill employers seriously do not care about those low skill positions. The competition was able to secure internships/research roles while you were trying to survive. It is in the employers best interest to choose the talent who has _slightly_ relevant work experience & uncertain work ethic VS no relevant work experience & equally uncertain work ethic.
- Notice the irony between the last two points (ie work toward the minimum effort; employers think you're doing this). It's extremely unlikely any of your high skill employers will reach out to your low skill employers to see if you were the exception.
- Note, I explored the naive "word harder" approach with a modest returns. I learned these deep rooted lessons over the course of 8 years but think these sunk in after about 2 years. Therefore, I'd recommend loans over full-time work (unless it's research-related & paid).

# Soft Lessons Learned from being Low Skill Labor
- Be kind. Even if I was having a tough day, I made the effort to be kind & polite. Others will naturally reciprocate, and it'll end up making your day better.
- If you're in university, these low skill positions will lower your debt burden. I ended up with a quarter of my counterfactual debt amount.
- Always tip. If you're out to eat, you should factor in tipping as part of your meal.
- "If you've lived exactly the life of another person, you'd likely be in their situation" is a mantra I still hold dear. I think this deepens empathy while also respecting one's agency as two people can have nearly identical experiences but have different outcomes. The variance of outcomes will have some average (or base rate likelihood) so knowing that is useful.
